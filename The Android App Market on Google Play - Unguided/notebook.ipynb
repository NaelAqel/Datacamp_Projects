    "<p>The Google Play Store apps data has enormous potential to facilitate data-driven decisions and insights for businesses. In this notebook, we will analyze the Android app market by comparing ~10k apps in Google Play across different categories.

    "## Note: This Project is Unguided  \n",
    "You work as a Data Analyst for a finance company which is closely eyeing the Android market before it launches its new app into Google Play. You have been asked to present an analysis of Google Play apps so that the team gets a comprehensive overview of different categories of apps, their ratings, and other metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This will require you to use your data manipulation and data analysis skills.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Your three questions are as follows:  \n",
    "1. **Read the `apps.csv` file and clean the `Installs` column to convert it into integer data type.** Save your answer as a DataFrame `apps`. Going forward, you will do all your analysis on the `apps` DataFrame.  \n",
    "2. **Find the number of apps in each category, the average price, and the average rating.** Save your answer as a DataFrame `app_category_info`. Your should rename the four columns as: `Category`, `Number of apps`, `Average price`, `Average rating`.\n",
    "3. **Find the top 10 free `FINANCE` apps having the highest average sentiment score.** Save your answer as a DataFrame `top_10_user_feedback`. Your answer should have exactly 10 rows and two columns named: `App` and `Sentiment Score`, where the average `Sentiment Score` is sorted from **highest to lowest**."
